# Programming-Algorithms

Battery of algorithms used in programming. The repository is divided into two sections: Algorithms and Constraint Programming.   

The first section contains all the algorithms implemented in Python for searching and sorting, as well as optimization problems. And, in the second section are all the problems implemented in MiniZinc for solving optimization problems through constrained programming.
